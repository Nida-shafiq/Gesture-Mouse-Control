# Gesture-Mouse-Control
This project creates a virtual mouse using hand gestures. With a webcam, it tracks your index finger to move the cursor and detects a click when the thumb and index finger touch. Built using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI, it offers a touchless, real-time way to control your PC.
